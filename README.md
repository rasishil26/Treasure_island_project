# 🏝️ Treasure Island – A Python Adventure Game

Hey there! 👋 I'm Rasi Shil, and this is my **Treasure Island** project — a beginner-level, text-based adventure game built with Python. This project was part of my early Python learning journey, and it helped me understand how to work with `if-else` statements and build user-driven interactive programs.

## 🎯 What This Game Is About

You’re on a mission to find a hidden treasure on an island!  
Your choices will decide your fate — choose wisely or the game ends for you.

You’ll be prompted to:
- Choose directions (like left or right)
- Make decisions (like swim or wait)
- Pick from options (like red, blue, or yellow doors)

Each choice leads you closer to the treasure or to a dead end! ☠️
